# Numerical Optimal Control (SS 2019) project

We implement a model predictive control (MPC) approach using direct multiple shooting for a model of neuronal oscillations.

## Requirements

* [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) (tested in R2018b)
* [CasADi](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

## Description

* run_plots.m: main file
* RK4integrator.m: single-step RK4 numerical integrator
* MPC.m: model predictive control implementation

## Acknowledgements

This code was partially based in the direct_multiple_shooting.m example from CasADi.

We would like to thank Florian Messerer and Prof. Moritz Diehl for the supervision in this project.
